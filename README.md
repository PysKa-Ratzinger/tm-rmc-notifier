# Trackmania RMC Notifier

A small program I made to check which streamers played which of my created
maps, and when.

If you decide to use this project, please respect both trackmania.io and
trackmania.exchange servers and do not remove the rate limiter.

As is, the project is not very efficient, but it works well enough for my
use-case. Do not use to track an exagerated ammount of maps at the same time.

## TODO

- When updating replays, create a notification for VIP (marked) users.
